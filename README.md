# vuex-state-app

This is a sample app based on learning from various sources on Vue + VueX + REST APIs.
There are two demos available

* Modified version of the post by [Raymond Camden](https://www.raymondcamden.com/2018/01/05/another-example-of-vuejs-and-vuex-an-api-wrapper
   - Upgraded to use the newer techniques of using Vuex 3
